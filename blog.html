					<p><strong>PRESS RELEASE - 25 DECEMBER 2014 - KIDSCONNECTNET.COM</strong></p>
					<br>
					<img src="images/christmaslogo.png">
					<p>CEO Tyler Malley announced that this Christmas, KidsConnect Staff Members and developers
					will <u>not</u> be working through the new year to allow for family time around the Holidays, but
					even with our staff off, we feel that today is a good time to announce our progress and 
					any updates we have been waiting to announce.
					<br>
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>
					<strong>Our Support Center</strong>
					</p>
					<p>We shut down our support center at http://support.kidsconnectnet.com on Wednesday, December 17, at 2:00pm. We decided
					that due to our low staff count that all support tickets will be posted directly to admins on the site using a contact form.
					If you have any problems, please email <a href="mailto:tylermalley@KidsConnectNET.com">Tyler Malley, CEO</a> until we launch our new contact page.
					</p>
					<br>
					<p><strong>Our Hosting</strong></p>
					<p>
					KidsConnectNET.com has moved its hosting over to a new home - DreamHost. We feel that this change will allow for bigger boundaries
					and that new horizons to be reached. At DreamHost, we now occupy our own Virtual Server which allows us to install chat clients and 
					make back-end changes that are needed prior to our launch! We will continue to update you on this exciting change!
					</p>
					<br>
					<p><strong>KidsConnect's "Vision"</strong></p>
					<p>
					We have been working on tweaking what we want on KidsConnect/how we want certain things to be made on KidsConnect! We
					cannot get into details yet, but you may have noticed minor changes implied or indicated. We <u>will</u> keep you posted on this matter!
					</p>
					<br>
					<p><strong>Follow us on Twitter; "Like" us on Facebook</strong></p>

					<p><strong>Hiring Section</strong></p>
					<p>We will be launching a "Hiring" Web Site for the "Our Brand" part of our Website! Please check there for
					any part time volunteer positions. We are working on contracts currently, and will begin "select-hiring" very
					soon!
					</p>
					<br>
					<p><strong>Launch ETA</strong></p>
					<p>We're going to be honest - We don't know how much longer it will take until we are done!
					Our CEO is our only coder currently. He works hard and does lots of work, but the problems
					do pile-up, and with one coder, it can be a timely project. We won't hazard a more SPECIFIC
					launch date except for Summer-Winter 2015 (most likely). We will try to keep you posted
					on any "launch date predictions".
					</p>
					<br>
					<p><strong>-- END PRESS RELEASE --</strong></p>
					<p>Also - Merry Christmas from our Team to your Family!</p>
